# HackerRank-Solutions

Every day I do some code for fun, and of course... to improve myself and learn something new :smiley:

## What can you find here?

Solutions to HackerRank problems, until now, about:

+ Python
+ SQL

### Notes

> The SQL problems were solved using MS SQL Server, but some of them, just a few, using MySQL due to little inconsistencies to adjust the output to the expected one, for example, errors by rounding (Extremely hard to handle in MS SQL without ugly code on occasion).
