# HackerRank-Solutions

Every day ( per year :sweat_smile:) I do some code for fun, and of course... to improve myself and learn something new :smiley:

## What can you find here?

Solutions to HackerRank problems, until now, about:

+ Python
+ SQL
+ C++
+ Regex (For the future)

### Notes

> The SQL problems were solved using MS SQL Server, but some of them, just a few, using MySQL due to little inconsistencies to adjust the output to the expected one, for example, errors by rounding (Extremely hard to handle in MS SQL without ugly code on occasion).

> Despite is not relevant, Regex problems were solved using Python as programming language.
